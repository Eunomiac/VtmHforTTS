Make a panel for
	showing and hiding huds (one button, right click to hide)
	dialog option: dropdown list of
		... players
		... all the possible controls they could click
	dialog option: change state value
		... enter, e.g. "turnState,Orange,powerCommitted = 5" and it'll parse it properly

make Reference hud use 'normal' UI hiding commands


Make sure consequences display disappears
Make buttons for spawning coin and power

fix tie notification to moderator's tiebreaking vote
if I can't fix turn hud, make all buttons visible
is aye button showing up underneath?

code up open agendas
add buttons for controlling appearance of UI elements in case they fuck up again
- consider coding a general light config for each player, highlighting territory with one light and focusing on capital with another



TEST
* Make moderator the one to toggle the buttons
* add zone that converts story cards to event cards when they're added to the event area
* add snapping to story cards when they're drawn
* add camera angles for signing stickers and story cards
* allow tagging cards "Trigger" and they're automatically handled when drawn

DONE
* configure map focus lights (instructions under LIGHTMODES)
* code in the ability to name the next king
* did the game end one card too early?
* check why crave isn't updating - check to make sure it's accurate in state, and that it remains on their screens



FUNCTION PREPARATION FOR HUD CONTROL (two steps):
lua key={b="Brown",r="Red",o="Orange",y="Yellow",g="Green"}
lua function hide(c) UI.hide("consequencesQuery_" .. key[string.lower(c)]) end; function aye(c) UI.show("turnHUD_voteAye_container_" .. key[string.lower(c)]) end; function nay(c) UI.show("turnHUD_voteNay_container_" .. key[string.lower(c)]) end

hide("b"), aye("R"), nay("g")
