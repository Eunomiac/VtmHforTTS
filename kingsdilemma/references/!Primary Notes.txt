- whoa, fix big error where if Trigger Card is drawn, it will pull a dilemma out of the played zone!
- fix Trigger card being shuffled itno deck, and what happens to its tags if it's moved to the event area?
  - trigger card moved to table, splash message to put above deck if it should be shuffled in
  - trigger cards in event area at end of game are shuffled into dilemma deck
- when does stability update? Need a better way to account for "off the board" movement



- figure out score graphic for Discord
- fix tie notification to moderator's tiebreaking vote
- turn pass card into a 'transfer' zone, with buttons to delete & to transfer contents to others
  - Splash message alerts all to whatever happened
