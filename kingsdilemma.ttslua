-- Great UI and spotlight opportunities
local NOTES = [[
	Board & Playspace
		Get some kind of medieval background
		Use a circular table, but only half of it (so it's semicircular) to ensure all players
			can see both each other's votes AND aren't facing the board contents upside-down

	Great UI and spotlight opportunities:
		Aye/Nay/Pass (results in colored spotlight aimed in front of house card, where power tokens are placed)
		Moderator/Leader (modifies turn order during voting phase, represented in UI AND by custom figurines or something)

	Automation
		At end of voting phase, power tokens can be counted and the outcome of the vote displayed
		Power tokens for aye/nay can be moved to proper locations

	Media
		Remake "signing" decals so they fit in the damn signature space
